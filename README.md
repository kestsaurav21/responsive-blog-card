### What I learned

##### 1) Understanding the Document Structure:
 By creating this HTML page, you improved your knowledge of document structure and semantics. For example, the use of main, h1, and p tags follows best practices, making your code more readable and accessible.

##### 2) Image Integration:
You worked with images (img tag) effectively, using alt attributes to ensure the content is accessible and SEO-friendly. This teaches you the importance of providing meaningful descriptions for non-visual browsers.

##### 3) Content Organization with Divs:

You learned how to group elements using div for better layout control. Each section (category, content, and author) is well-organized, making it easier to style with CSS.
##### 4) Linking External Resources:

You included external stylesheets and icons, improving your understanding of linking resources in an HTML document.
##### 5) Responsive Design with the meta Viewport:

By using the meta tag for viewport configuration, you ensured that the blog card is responsive, adjusting its layout on different devices.
